Detailed comments on the paper
------------------------------
Some minor comments:
+ The Predicted Price Duration Curve and also other duration curves should be defined clearly.

- Further define these mathematically and clearly


+ In Equations 10 and 11 it is unclear why the duration curves are used, and not the actual and approximated time series.

- Check all of these comments.
