The authors train on data from 2013-2017, and then validate on 2018. Data from 2018-2035 is the expected behaviour according to BEIS. So realistically, actual data of only 2018 is present. If the results were also validated against actual data of 2019 or even 2017, only then the comparisons against BEIS data till 2035 will look convincing.

- Better explain that the data is trained using historical data from the previous 20+ years


The authors have not justified the value of parameters considered. For example, in second para Section 5.3, 60 scenarios were considered without providing any details; in Sections 4.4.1/2, how the values for m and c were selected in not specified.

- Further explain why values m and c were chosen. 


The paper's contribution is weak. They use a k-means rather than Ward's hierarchical, but without any comparison it's not clear if this provides any advantage. Testing the model is very weak, with little discussion about how the model compares to BEIS.

- Could compare different clustering methods? I believe I originally did this, but didn't put this in the paper due to length constraints of the paper.


Capital costs $C_c$ is the most crucial factor in your model. Split between ongoing (variable) costs and capital costs, the big difference between your set of fossil fuel (low cap costs), nuclear (high cap costs), and renewable energy generation (very high cap costs) is the influence of capital costs on economic feasibility. However, there isn't any clear info about where these costs are derived from. It's highly likely that you're ignoring the vast underreporting of capital expenditure in nuclear power plant projects. See e.g. DOI:10.1016/j.tej.2009.03.010.

- Could put in a table in the appendix to show all costs taken from BEIS and IEA/IRENA

The article leaves one wondering much about how representative days were chosen. $REE_av$ increases as cluster numbers increase. This is strange - why is this observed? Also, why are all these different metrics used to choose cluster count? What does each represent that the other does not? What do the values mean; e.g. is NRMSE = 5 relatively high or low?

- Look further into this.

The study presented in the paper builds on the framework ElecSim, but unfortunately, this model is not described sufficiently in the paper. Accordingly it is very difficult to assess the improvements of the model due to the representative days, and the role of the optimized predicted price duration curve. While the overall presentation is often very detailed, some relevant definitions are not given in detail or remain unclear.

- I'm not sure we have much space to put in full details about ElecSim?
- Check definitions

Detailed comments on the paper
------------------------------
Some minor comments:
+ The Predicted Price Duration Curve and also other duration curves should be defined clearly.

- Further define these mathematically and clearly

+ The price duration curve was modelled linearly, is this a limiting factor?

- Potentially could be, but argue that it is the closest fit. Potentially further work here to compare fits.

+ The genetic algorithms for doing the optimization have been briefly motivated, but since this a central method of the study, more discussions or studies would have been interesting.

- Can further speak about this if we have time?

+ There is a typo in Equation 1, $t$ should be replaced by $i$. - DONE
+ Equation 2 should be checked - why is there a summation over $t$? What is the index $m$? Why are the capital costs included?
+ There are typos in Equation 4, in the $\min$ the first $m$ should be replaced by $m_y$, and the second $m$ should be replaced by $c_y$. - DONE
+ The explanation of the procedure from Equation 7 to Equation 9 should be clarified.
+ In Equations 10 and 11 it is unclear why the duration curves are used, and not the actual and approximated time series.
+ Are references [32] and [33] the same? - DONE
